                   (8 THINGS TO ADOPT TO BECOME A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER)
          
1: Nobody in this world is a naturally logic builder or savant in programming OR 
   No one learns by coming out of their mother's womb.They develop their mind frame
   by keep practising.lets ask python to retort.......

  def BuildComputerScientistBrain(practice):
    if practice == "true":
        print("Initializing....")
        #setting important variables
        isLearingPattrens = True
        isAdoptingMachineBehaviour = True
        isMachinePsychology = True
        if isLearingPattrens ==True and isAdoptingMachineBehaviour == True and isMachinePsychology == True:
            print("Successfully Created....")

    else:
        print("Failed to build")

   #upto you to set practice equals to true or waste your time to make it false
   practice = input().lower()
   BuildComputerScientistBrain(practice)


2: Respect Your Tutor , who is teaching you don't make yourself embarass by assuming 
   you know everything.

3: Donot consider yourself savant i.e While studying a particular course, assume you
   have no idea of it  (Even having prior knowledge of it) so work for it,research for
   it and PRACTICE FOR IT.The course can be any  i.e  Data structures and Algorithms.
   Donot embarras to ask or fear from tutor's questioning --> go for it tell him 
   whatever you got for that particular query.Donot fear what other students including
   male or female would say.(Specially BOYS so chill). 

4: Use Internet i.e youtube,google are two of the major sources to learn whatever you 
   want they have absorbed all the secrets to explore and learn something new. 

5: Try to master atleast 2 programming languages currently running in the favour of
   market trend.

6: After all odds mentioned above try to learn from people's code or watch their skillful hands ask them to extract their
   knowledge.

7: Maintain your codes on Github.

8: Start teaching whatever you got to your students.Share knowlede......

9: The day without Bugs would be the worst programming days of your life.So, if you have bugs in your code Congratulations You are on the Right Track.

10: Your brain is like a Machine which is learning pattrens to extract answer for furthur following queries the more accurately it would be trained,
   the more accurate results it would give.But as a human we can be more efficient (weak AI followers would agree) so
   "BELEIVE IN THE NEWLY PROCESSING YOU" HAPPY CODING......................!!
